      "message": "Our team is responsible for Chromium build tools, and now that we are starting to look more and more into Bazel as part of our experiments, I would us to be able to make changes to these scripts if required (of course knowing that these are shared with CrOS, so we should still coordinate and ask for reviews for anything that changes the behavior in an incompatible way!).\n\nThe scripts themselves say that it\u0027s fine for others to use and make edits to them as required: \"It\u0027s currently used by ChromiumOS, but is intended for use and to be updated by any depot_tools users who are using Bazel.\"\n\n@jrosenth@chromium.org As the author of the current scripts, is that OK with you?",

      "message": "The cost in complexity and mental load of having OWNER rules down to individual files is much higher than having to review a CL for that script (there was exactly one CL in the time since August 1, when it was added, which was a trivial formatting change).\n\nI want to simplify and set everything up so that we can work efficiently, instead of always having to work through tiny little things before we can do something.\n\nIt is in our team\u0027s mission to own and maintain the build tooling used by Chromium. I would like to set this up now once and then not have to deal or think about it anymore.\n\n(I just realized we didn\u0027t even have ownership of the goma* files here...)",

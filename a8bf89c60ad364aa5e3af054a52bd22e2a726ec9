      "message": "Okay, I understand the issue. Before your change GetVSPath always returned a string, so ExpandWildcards runs without failing, and later on we have a chance to detect that we had zero matches and say that.\n\nWith your change GetVSPath returns None if it doesn\u0027t find a match. Probably the best way to avoid this regression is to have a check - either in GetVSPath or after it is called - for a None result, and translate it to a clear message. Failing cryptically inside os.fspath with \"TypeError: expected str, bytes or os.PathLike object, not NoneType\" is confusing.",

      "message": "I previously misunderstood what you meant. I understand now.\n\nI struggled for a bit to recreate what you were seeing. When I uninstall VS it leaves parts of the VS installer, which includes vswhere.exe. On all 3 commits (origin/main, 234398a1, and this CL), I get the same behavior. But it is different from what you were seeing.\n\nI then tried renaming vswhere.exe to mimic a fresh VM with no VS uninstall leftovers. But that crashed elsewhere and didn\u0027t seem to be what we cared about.\n\nI then reinstalled only VS 2022 and not VS 2019 and I now see behavior like what you described.\n\n(Although the fix seems simple enough, I would like to have at least tested it locally. So recreating the behavior was important.)\n\nI fixed it by simply initializing the value being returned to \"\" instead of None.",

      "message": "One concern about this change is that it encourages/enables packaging the VS toolchain on a machine that has multiple installs of VS. In an ideal world this wouldn\u0027t matter, but in practice there might be some cross-contamination, or some variation caused by having an ongoing (installed and then upgraded) version. That is, I\u0027ve usually done the install on a clean VM created for this purpose in order to increase the odds of reproducibility.\n\nOn the other hand, being able to test on your workstation is certainly handy, and maybe these cross-contamination fears are unfounded.\n\nAnother way to solve your problem would be to uninstall VS 2019. That\u0027s what I did a few days ago, \u0027cause I\u0027ve fully switched to VS 2022.\n",

      "message": "I see what you mean about limiting the size of the test matrix. It makes for a very strong case.\n\nI am not opposed to abandoning this change if you prefer that.\n\nMy situation is likely atypical. My intention is to dev on my Linux machine and additionally test on my Windows machine. Originally, I preferred to not buy an additional Windows license for a VM. But I do admit it would make for a cleaner dev situation. I was hoping after I got through setup it wouldn\u0027t be an issue.\n\n(As a side thought, VS 2022 isn\u0027t yet listed as supported. Is there anything in particular we should confirm before we can list support? https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/tools/depot_tools/+/main:win_toolchain/package_from_installed.py;l\u003d54;drc\u003d399c5918bf47ff1fe8477f27b57fa0e8c67e438d )",

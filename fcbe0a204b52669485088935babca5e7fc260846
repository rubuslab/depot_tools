      "message": "After thinking about it more I think that the conditional adding of a path separator makes sense. If an empty string is passed then that would indicate that we want to match all paths, and appending a slash might break that. I\u0027m not sure if that is important, but it at least seems reasonable. But, we\u0027ll have to see what Josip thinks.",

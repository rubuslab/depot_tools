      "message": "The regular and Windows presubmit bots failed. And there\u0027s a merge conflict, so I\u0027m not sure how much investigation is worth doing before that is resolved.\n\nThe one presubmit error (on the Linux bot) is from Pylint. It is purely line-length errors so I\u0027m not sure why that is fatal. The error messages printed cleanly, if not in the most friendly way:\n\n** Presubmit ERRORS: 1 **\nPylint (145 files on 8 processes)\n/b/s/w/ir/kitchen-checkout/depot_tools/pylint-2.7 --args-on-stdin (42.64s) failed\n************* Module clang_format\nclang_format.py:42:0: C0301: Line too long (81/80) (line-too-long)\nclang_format.py:65:0: C0301: Line too long (81/80) (line-too-long)\n...\n\nIt looks like the Windows presubmit timed out for some reason:\n\nStep had exit code: 3221225786 (a.k.a. 0xC000013A)\nStep timed out.",
